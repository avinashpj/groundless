# GROUNDLESS
This is a complete prototype of the game. You will be able to play the some levels and create anothers. I developed a way to resolve the puzzles using an A* Algorithm, so you can make more levels and try them.

## Gameplay
The goal in Pyramids of Ra is to clear each stage of every tile, while also managing to return to the starting point. Players can move one tile in each direction (up, down, left, right), although it is possible to "jump off" the playing field, as well as the possibility of destroying the incorrect tiles to trap the player or render some tiles inaccessible.

## Controls
+ Arrows or Swipe: to move character in each direction;
+ Space: to resolve the puzzle (if possible).
